# Weapon-Detection-using-yolov5
This was the task given to us to perform object detection on custom dataset using yolov5
So here I have used gun dataset of 322 Images(266 train,66 val)

For performing this on your machine,check the .ipynb file and perform all the steps.

The data folder contains images and labels for both train and validation(classes:['Gun'])
